## General Information

This project was my submission for CSE 108 Object Oriented Programming Lab term project in Level 1/Term 2 at BUET CSE Undergrad.
We were given the requirements to make a player management application. **[At first stage](https://github.com/Mohaimin41/Java_Term_Project_1/tree/main/console)**, we simulated it in the console. **[At the second stage](https://github.com/Mohaimin41/Java_Term_Project_1/tree/main/JavaFX/java_term_project)** we used JavaFX to make a graphical UI for the application. In this app, users can -

- **login to a central server** via the clients
- **list the players** of other clubs
- **look for a specific player**
- **manage** own player salary
- **buy players** if own club has enough money
- **put players** up for **sell**

</p>

- Java - version 17
- JavaFX - version 19

The network connection is done using **Java Socket IO**. The different views of the GUI app was created using **SceneBuilder** integrated in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Project Status

Project is: _not being worked on anymore_ .


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:

- Use dedicated database
- Allow the different scenes of the GUI App to be loaded on same window instead of each creating new one
- Improve the UI/UX design


## Resources Used

- I followed the **youtube channel thenewboston's [JavaFX Java GUI Design Tutorials](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBzfXLWLSYVy8EbTdpGbUIG) playlist** to get general idea and necessary concepts about JavaFX

## Acknowledgements

I would like to specially give my heartfelt thanks to my honourable professor **[Dr. Rifat Shahriyar](https://rifatshahriyar.github.io/)**. He taught us Java from scratch, showed us the beauties and inner intricacies of the language, trained us to write OOP codes. The networking code is directly sourced from his Java Networking Class codes. He is an excellent teacher and an even better human being.

This project could not have been done without me constantly asking for help from my friend **[Sadif Ahmed](https://github.com/sadif-ahmed)**. He always took his time to give me whatever help I needed.

A special shoutout to **[this cat](https://github.com/Siam11651)** for helping me out anytime I needed. He gave me much needed pushes and helped me debug many problems.
